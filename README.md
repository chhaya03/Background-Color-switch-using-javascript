# Background-change
Using Javascript

This project demonstrates a basic yet fundamental concept in web development: manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. The project features a web page with a button, which, when clicked, changes the background color of the page. This interactive feature enhances user experience and showcases the dynamic capabilities of JavaScript.
